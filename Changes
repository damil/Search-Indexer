Revision history for Perl extension Search::Indexer.

0.70 Feb 6th. First public release.

0.71 25.05.2005 - Internal structure change : use Btree instead of Hash for
                  ixw and ixp. This takes more space but allows us to walk
                  through words in the dictionary, or through words in a 
	          given doc. INDEXES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSION,
	          you need to reindex your docs.
		- "add" method : check that $docId is a fresh number
		- "remove" method : no longer necessary to supply text buffer;
	          just give the docId to remove
	        - new method "words" and "wordIds"
	        - modified "translateQuery" for compatibility with 
	          Search::QueryParser v0.91
